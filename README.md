## Project Description

This project focuses on preprocessing customer data, including cleaning noisy data, normalizing features, and removing outliers. The processed data will be used for subsequent analysis and modeling.

## Folder Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the raw and processed datasets.

## Data Cleaning

The `data_cleaning.py` script implements data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, duplicates, and other inconsistencies.

## Data Normalization

The `data_normalization.py` script normalizes the features of the dataset, ensuring a consistent scale for analysis.

## Outlier Removal

The `outlier_removal.py` script identifies and removes outliers from the dataset, enhancing the overall data quality.

## Getting Started
