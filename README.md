## Project Description

This project focuses on preprocessing customer data, including cleaning noisy data, normalizing features, and removing outliers. The processed data will be used for subsequent analysis and modeling.

## Folder Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- **`src/`**: Holds the source code for data processing.
- **`visualizations/`**: Stores plots and graphs generated from the processed data.

## Data Cleaning

The `data_cleaning.py` script in the `src/` directory implements data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, duplicates, and other inconsistencies.

## Data Normalization

The `data_normalization.py` script in the `src/` directory normalizes the features of the dataset, ensuring a consistent scale for analysis.

## Outlier Removal

The `outlier_removal.py` script in the `src/` directory identifies and removes outliers from the dataset, enhancing the overall data quality.

## Data Visualization

The `data_visualization.py` script in the `src/` directory generates visualizations and plots based on the processed data. The resulting graphs are saved in the `visualizations/` folder.

## Getting Started

To run the data processing pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
3. Run the data processing scripts in the specified order.

## Dependencies

List the dependencies required to run the scripts. For example:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- ...
